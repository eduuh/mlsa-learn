## The greatest challange.

The problem I find is that in our **institution** is we are learning outdated Programming languages and outdated workflows. The institutional learning is not as dynamic as it should be. This is a **shared challange** among my peers in the University.

When I was in first year, I got to learn **java version 4** and a **a water fall development process** programming workflows while the latest was _Java 7_. This was a problem to most of use when we were given a project to work on. Having installed the latest and greatest tools, our source code could not run due to syntax errors. We had to either downgrade our compiler to required version or learn the "latest version" in order to proceed.
